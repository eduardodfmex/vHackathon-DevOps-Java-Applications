Java DevOps Practices as a Strategy to Win Java Customers

Since 1996 Java Programming Language has been a key technology enabler for several services, business and organizations. Today, due the widespread popularity of Android Platform, Java is the most popular mobile dev language and the second most popular among the 2.2 million public GitHub repositories \[[source](http://githut.info/)\], surpassed only by javascript.

At Enterprise Level, Java Enterprise Edition had a widespread adoption in the last decade. Several mid and large scale businesses as Banks, Telcos, Retails, etc adopted Java EE as an evolution of the traditional Client-Server Architecture. Currently, a large number of organizations are relying in Java EE Application Server Infrastructure and Java-related Dev Processes to run their operations and services in a daily basis.

Traditional software Vendors like IBM, Oracle and SAP have their own Java EE-compliant Servers coexisting with popular Open Source certified implementations from Apache Foundation and RedHat. Also a healthy and vibrant open ecosystem is contributing with a large set of tools, libraries and frameworks which complement and extends main specification. Some examples include log4j -a popular logging framework-, Lucene -a search engine-, and Hibernate -an O/R database access layer-.

Professional Java developers and Java-enabled customers havenâ€™t been addressed by Microsoft with a value proposition that leverage their own set of knowledge, frameworks, libraries, servers and tools. In the other hand, the DevOps trend is gaining traction among Devs and Operations and this is key to leverage our own set of tools like Visual Studio Team Services and Azure, to build on top of Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery and Release Management Practices driving java development process to Microsoft platforms and leaving Java Workloads in a closer position with Azure.

Is interesting to notice that in the last years, Microsoft has been working to improve support for Java developers on Azure through eclipse and IntelliJ pluggins, integrating java-dev process deeply into Visual Studio Team Services and leveraging common Java-based tools like Maven, Junit, Jenkings, Ant and Graddle, and also simplified Java App Server provisioning through Virtual Machines and Azure Websites.

We expect to Win share % of this market, creating a sample dev process using a well-known Java EE application, showing a clear value proposition supporting Java with VSTS and Azure.
